The data considers the age of the kids on the show, starting from 6 up to 14.

This can be seen in the mean which increased from 9.85 to 10. Both the variance and standard deviation shrunk from 6.41 and 2.53 to 5.43 and 2.33 respectively. This happens because Cindy was the youngest child so her age increase gave our data a tighter distribution.

This also changes the standard deviation which is calculated from the variance. \n",
