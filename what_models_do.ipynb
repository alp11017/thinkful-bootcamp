This is because each flip of the coin does not depend on any previous flip and has an equal chance of being either heads or tails. There are very few things we can add to this model to better represent reality as long as we assume that we have an equally weighted or \"fair\" coin. Adding other features would quickly make this model unnecessarily complex and wouldn't necessarily give us a better estimate. "
